## Introduction

The humble plane, a flat, infinitely thin surface that extends infinitely. It might not seem much, but it's used everywhere for ray-intersections, from AABBs, to voxels, triangle meshes, BVHs, convex polyhedrons and many more. One could even say it is the building block of raytracing. Today we will derive an intersection of a ray with a plane.

## Derivation

A ray can be defined as its origin $ O $, unit direction $ \hat D $, and the ray parameter $ t $, which is the distance to get to our intersection point $ P $, and what we are trying to solve:

$$ P = O + \hat D t $$

There are two ways we can derive the intersection of a ray and a plane, algebraically and geometrically. The former is quite straightforward, but the latter may provide us with some insight on how it works.

### Algebraic derivation

The plane equation is defined as such:

$$ P \cdot \hat N = d $$

where $ P $ is any point, $ N $ the unit normal of the plane, and $ d $ the signed distance of $ P $ to the plane. When $ d = 0 $, $ P $ lies exactly on the plane.

To get the interesction of the ray to the plane, we substitute the ray equation into the plane equation and solve for $ t $:

$$ (O + \hat D t) \cdot \hat N = 0 $$

We can separate the terms inside the dot product using the distributive and the scalar multiplication property of the dot product[^1]:

$$ O \cdot \hat N + \hat D t \cdot \hat N = 0 $$

$$ O \cdot \hat N + (\hat D \cdot \hat N)t = 0 $$

Rearranging the terms to get $ t $, we then get our solution:

$$ t = -\frac {O \cdot \hat N} {\hat D \cdot \hat N} $$

### Geometric derivation

The derivation above is straightforward, but it didn't really quite tell us how it works. The geometric derivation on the other hand can give us insights using some properties of the dot product.

Below we can see how the intersection of the ray and the plane in 2D:

We know from trigonometry that:

$$ \cos(\theta) = \frac {\mathrm {adjacent}} {\mathrm {hypotenuse}} $$

We are solving for the hypotenuse which is $ t $, and the adjacent being $ d $:

$$ \mathrm {hypotenuse} = \frac {\mathrm {adjacent}} {\cos(\theta)} $$

$$ t = \frac {d} {\cos(\theta)} $$

The dot product is defined as such:

$$ A \cdot B = \cos(\theta) ~ |A| ~ |B| $$

When one of the vector is of unit length, the result of their dot product is a scalar projection[^2] of $ A $ along $ \hat B $:

$$ A \cdot \hat B = \cos(\theta) ~ |A| $$

From it, we can compute the adjacent $ d $ from the ray position $ O $ and the normal $ N $:

$$ O \cdot \hat N = d $$


The result of the dot product of two unit vectors is the cosine of the angle between them:

$$ \hat A \cdot \hat B = \cos(\theta) $$

Therefore, we take the dot product of the ray direction and the normal, with the result negated as they are pointing away from each other:

$$ -\hat D \cdot \hat N = \cos(\theta) $$

Putting everything together, we get our solution as before:

$$ t = -\frac {O \cdot \hat N} {\hat D \cdot \hat N} $$


## Usage

In code our formula looks like so, we also add a check when there is no intersection, which is when $ t < 0 $ :

```glsl
float rayPlaneIntersection(vec3 rayOrigin, vec3 rayDir, vec3 normal) {
    float t = -dot(rayOrigin, normal) / dot(rayDir, normal);
    if (t < 0.0) {
        return MAX_DISTANCE; // No hit
    }
    return t;
}
```

To get our hit position, we simply take our ray parameter and plug it in the ray equation:

```glsl
float t = rayPlaneIntersection(rayOrigin, rayDir, planeNormal);
vec3 position = rayOrigin + rayDir * t;
```

## Plane Fun Facts

- The ray does not intersect the plane when the ray origin is outside the plane and the ray is pointing away from it. This is the sign of the ray parameter $ t $ as seen from the code above.

- We can tell what side of the plane we are interescting from the sign of the dot product of the ray direction and the normal. If $ D \cdot \hat N $ is $ < 0 $, then we are intersecting the front face, otherwise the back face.

- If the normal $ \hat N $ is axis aligned, the dot product would be simplified to a selection of a component of the vector with the normal's axis, e.g.:

$$ \hat N = (0, 1, 0) $$

$$ O \cdot \hat N = O_y $$

- The formula above is for a plane that is located at the origin. To translate the plane at position $ Q $, we can subtract it to the ray origin to get a plane located at $ Q $:

$$ t = -\frac {(O - Q) \cdot \hat N} {\hat D \cdot \hat N} $$

- Alternatively, we can translate the plane using a scalar $ d $ instead, where $ d $ can be thought of as the plane distance from the origin along $ \hat N $:

$$ t = -\frac {O \cdot \hat N - d} {\hat D \cdot \hat N} $$

As we have seen, as simple as the plane is there is quite a bit more to them. <br>
Stay tuned on the next part where we extend this using multiple planes to intersect boxes! Seeya! üê∏
